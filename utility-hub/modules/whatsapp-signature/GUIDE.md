This module allows you to quickly add a custom signature to your messages on WhatsApp Web.

## Features

## How to Use
1. Open the Utility Hub extension and select **WhatsApp Sig**.
2. Type your desired signature in the text field. It saves automatically!
3. Go to [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com).
