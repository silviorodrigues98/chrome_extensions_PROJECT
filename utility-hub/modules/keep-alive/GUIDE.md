# ☕ Keep Alive Guide

Prevent web sessions from timing out or your status from going offline.

## Features
- **Activity Simulation**: Subtly simulates user actions to keep the session active.
- **Sound Alert**: Optional audio feedback to confirm the module is working.
- **Stay Connected**: Keeps your connection "green" on sites that monitor idle time.

## How to Use
1. Open the tab you want to keep active.
2. Open Utility Hub and select **Keep Alive**.
3. (Optional) Toggle the **Feedback Sonoro** if you want to hear a ping when active.
4. Click **Ativar** to start.

## Note
The module works best when the tab is pinned or kept in a separate window, as some browsers heavily throttle background tabs.
