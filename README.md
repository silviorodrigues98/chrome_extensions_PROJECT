**Utility Hub** is a powerful, open-source Chrome extension designed to be the ultimate "Swiss Army Knife" for productivity. Instead of installing a dozen single-purpose extensions, Utility Hub brings together essential tools into one lightweight, privacy-focused package.

Everything runs locally. No tracking. No bloat. Just the tools you need to get work done.

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Auto Reload
Keep your tabs fresh and updated automatically. Perfect for monitoring dashboards, grabbing limited-time slots, or developing web apps.
- **Custom Intervals**: Set reload times from seconds to minutes.
- **Hard Reload**: Option to bypass cache (`Ctrl+F5` equivalent) to see the latest changes.
- **Visual Status**: A green 'AR' badge lets you know which tabs are being monitored.
- **Smart Management**: Controls are isolated per tab, so you can manage multiple reload timers simultaneously.

### ☕ Keep Alive
Prevent session timeouts and keep your status connected on varied web services.
- **Activity Simulation**: Simulates subtle mouse movements and key presses to convince the site you are active.
- **Network Pings**: Optionally sends low-profile network requests to keep the connection alive.
- **Sound Alert**: Optional audio feedback when a keep-alive ping occurs (good for debugging or monitoring).
- **Background Run**: Works even when the tab is not in focus.

### ✍️ WhatsApp Signature
Streamline your professional or personal messaging on WhatsApp Web.
- **Floating Button**: A discreet "pen" icon is injected directly into the WhatsApp chat footer for instant access.
- **Global Shortcut**: Use `Alt + S` to quickly append your signature without leaving the keyboard.
- **Custom Text**: Easily update your signature text through the Utility Hub popup.
- **Robust Insertion**: Uses advanced DOM manipulation to work reliably with WhatsApp's modern Lexical editor.

### 🔜 Coming Soon
We are actively building new modules! Planned features include:
- **Form Filler**: Save and fill repetitive forms.
- **Tab Suspender**: Save memory by suspending unused tabs.
- **Note Taker**: Quick scratchpad for every tab.
